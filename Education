Learning coding from day 0. This is my progress tracking tool.

Day 0: signed up for Harvardx- CS50x. Also signed up for CodeAcademy Pro. (Now i wont lie i have learned C++ in the past in College and wrote a program in Java for my final project but that was nearly 10 years ago.)
Day 1: Watched Week 0,1,2 of CS50x.
Day 2: Worked in Code Academy. Realized i was over my head when it set me on the course full-stack engineering and found programs that start me off from square one. 
Completed course: Welcome to CodeAcademy. Working on: Learn how to code. Wrote this code that made me feel like i can code:

// Build a list (already written in the script by code academy)
comicStrip = ['Codey sees the trail', 'Codey starts the hike', 'Codey is halfway', 'codey reaches the finish']

// select the 4th item from the list (already written in the script by code academy)
// and save it to the variable selection (already written in the script by code academy)
selection = comicStrip[3]
